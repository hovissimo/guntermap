An exercise in mapping, with data!

I've been using Automate on my phone to log data to my Firebase (www.firebase.com) whenever my phone connects to or disconnects from my car.

Let's see what we can do with that data.  (There are plenty of gapsin the data.  This is usually because Automate isn't perfect and I don't notice that it stopped working)
